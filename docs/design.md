# Game Design and Architecture

## Game Overview
Robotic Homestead Tycoon is a simulation/tycoon game where players build and manage a homestead powered by automated robots. The core loop involves planning farmland layouts, assigning robots to plant, water, harvest and transport crops, managing renewable energy and finances, and investing in research to unlock upgrades. The aim is to balance efficiency, sustainability and profitability while expanding your homestead.

### Key Features
- **Farming Automation:** Robots handle repetitive tasks like planting, watering, harvesting and transportation, freeing the player to focus on strategy.
- **Resource Management:** Players manage energy systems (solar panels, batteries), finances and crop rotations to keep the homestead running smoothly.
- **Progression and Research:** Upgrades and new technologies unlock improved robots, energy efficiency and advanced crops.
- **Customization:** The layout of fields, placement of buildings and selection of robot types allow diverse strategies.
- **Educational Value:** Demonstrates principles of robotics, sustainable agriculture and resource optimization.

## Module Structure

| Module | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `src/main.py` | Program entry point and main game loop |
| `src/game/environment.py` | Simulates time, seasons and weather |
| `src/game/robot.py` | Defines robot classes and behaviors |
| `src/game/homestead.py` | Manages fields, crops, finances and energy |
| `src/game/__init__.py` | Package initialization |

The modular design allows contributors to extend or replace individual components without affecting the rest of the system. For example, a new `market.py` module could be added for selling crops, or specialized robot types can be added to `robot.py` without changing existing code.

## Class Sketches

### Environment
```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.time = 0  # simulation time step
        self.weather = "clear"  # placeholder for weather state

    def update(self):
        """Advance time, update weather and other environmental factors."""
        self.time += 1
        # Update weather patterns, seasons, etc.
```

### Robot
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, robot_id, role, location=(0, 0)):
        self.id = robot_id
        self.role = role  # e.g. 'planter', 'waterer', 'harvester'
        self.energy = 100.0
        self.location = location

    def move(self, new_location):
        """Move the robot to a new location and consume energy."""
        # Update location and reduce energy

    def perform_action(self, environment, homestead):
        """Perform the robot's assigned task based on its role."""
        pass

    def recharge(self):
        """Recharge the robot using the homestead's energy system."""
        self.energy = 100.0
```

### Homestead
```python
class Homestead:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fields = []   # list of Field objects (future enhancement)
        self.robots = []   # robots currently owned by the player
        self.money = 0.0
        self.energy_storage = 0.0

    def add_robot(self, robot):
        self.robots.append(robot)

    def plant_crop(self, field, crop_type):
        pass

    def harvest(self, field):
        pass

    def update(self, environment):
        """Update all robots and fields each time step."""
        for robot in self.robots:
            robot.perform_action(environment, self)
```

These sketches are illustrative and will be fleshed out over time.

## Visual Style

The visual style should blend the more realistic farming landscapes seen in *Farming Simulator 16* with glossy, colorful characters and interfaces reminiscent of *FarmVille* or *PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator*. This means:

- Detailed fields, buildings and machinery that communicate a working farm.
- Robots designed with a friendly, approachable aesthetic.
- Bright colors and clear UI icons to make the game inviting and easy to understand.

## Future Directions

- Expand crop variety, seasons and weather effects.
- Add an economy system with fluctuating crop prices and markets.
- Implement a research and technology tree for unlocking advanced robots and tools.
- Integrate a graphical user interface or 3D rendering engine.
- Add multiplayer or cooperative modes.
