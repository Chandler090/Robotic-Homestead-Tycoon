# Robotic Homestead Tycoon

Robotic Homestead Tycoon is a simulation/tycoon game that challenges you to build and manage a robot-powered homestead. Players design farmland layouts, invest in automated robots to plant, water and harvest crops, and manage renewable energy, research upgrades and finances in order to expand their homestead.

## Overview

- Build a thriving homestead using robots for farming tasks such as planting, watering, harvesting, and transport.
- Earn income by selling crops and reinvest profits in energy systems, new robots and research upgrades.
- Balance sustainability, efficiency and profitability while expanding your fields and infrastructure.
- Modular design encourages community contributions and modifications.

## Goals

- **Accessible simulation** – Provide a fun and educational look at robotics and sustainable farming.
- **Gradual complexity** – Start simple and unlock more advanced systems as you progress.
- **Modular architecture** – Keep code organized and extensible, making it easy for contributors to add features or create mods.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chandler090/Robotic-Homestead-Tycoon.git
cd Robotic-Homestead-Tycoon
```

2. **Install dependencies**

At this early stage there are no external dependencies. Future versions may use libraries such as `pygame` for graphics or `numpy` for simulation. Use a virtual environment and install requirements from a `requirements.txt` file when available.

3. **Run the prototype**

Run the main script to launch the simple simulation loop:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

The prototype prints simulation updates to the console. As the project evolves it will include a graphical interface and interactive gameplay.
